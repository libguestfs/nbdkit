# Open an nbdkit-vddk-plugin connection to the first disk of a guest
# on a VMware vCenter server.  This script automates the tedious bits
# of getting the disk name, moref, etc.  However please read the
# nbdkit-vddk-plugin documentation as well.
#
# For VMware ESXi, see scripts/vddk-esxi-open.sh{,.in}
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/vddk-vcenter-open.sh VC-SERVER VPX-URI GUEST -r -f -v libdir=/path/to/vmware-vix-disklib-distrib [...]
#
# where:
#
# VC-SERVER is the hostname or IP address of the vCenter server
#
# VPX-URI is the libvirt vpx:// URI, typically something like:
#   'vpx://root@vcenter-server/data/esxi-server?no_verify=1'
# (https://libvirt.org/drvesx.html)
#
# GUEST is the name of the guest.
#
# These three required parameters are followed by any extra nbdkit
# parameters you want to use, such as VDDK libdir, flags, filters etc.
#
# Note that the script runs ./nbdkit (ie. the wrapper in the top build
# directory).
