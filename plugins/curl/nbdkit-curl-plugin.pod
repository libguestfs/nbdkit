=head1 NAME

nbdkit-curl-plugin - nbdkit curl plugin (HTTP, FTP, SSH and other protocols)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit -r curl [url=]http://example.com/disk.img

 nbdkit -r curl [url=]sftp://you@example.com/~/disk.img

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-curl-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which turns content
served over HTTP, FTP, SSH, and more, into a Network Block Device.  It
uses a library called libcurl (also known as cURL) to read data from
URLs.  The exact list of protocols that libcurl can handle depends on
how it was compiled, but most versions will handle HTTP, HTTPS, FTP,
FTPS and SFTP (see: S<C<curl -V>>).  For more information about
libcurl, see L<http://curl.haxx.se>.

B<Note:> This plugin supports writes.  However:

=item *

For HTTP, you may not want nbdkit to issue PUT requests to the remote server
(which probably doesn't understand them).

=item *

SFTP helpfully truncates the target file when you open it for writing.
Not useful!

B<To force nbdkit to use a readonly connection, pass the I<-r> flag>.

=head2 EXAMPLES

=head3 Basic usage

 nbdkit -r curl http://example.com/disk.img

which serves the remote disk image as a NBD on TCP port 10809 (to
control ports and protocols used to serve NBD see L<nbdkit(1)>).

=head3 Accessing SSH servers

You can also access SSH servers.  This uses the SFTP protocol which is
built into most SSH servers:

 nbdkit -r curl sftp://example.com/~/disk.img

You may need to specify a username and/or a password.  In this example
the password is read from stdin:

 nbdkit -r curl sftp://example.com/~/disk.img username=fred password=-

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<password=>PASSWORD

Set the password to use when connecting to the remote server.

Note that passing this on the command line is not secure on shared
machines.

=item B<password=->

Ask for the password (interactively) when nbdkit starts up.

=item B<password=+>FILENAME

Read the password from the named file.  This is the most secure method
to supply a password, as long as you set the permissions on the file
appropriately.

=item B<sslverify=0>

Don't verify the SSL certificate of the remote host.

=item B<timeout=>SECS

Set the timeout for requests.

=item B<timeout=0>

Use the default libcurl timeout for requests.

=item B<url=>URL

The URL of the remote disk image.  This is passed to libcurl directly
via L<curl_easy_setopt(3)/CURLOPT_URL>.

This parameter is required.

In nbdkit E<ge> 1.8.2, C<url=> may be omitted.

=item B<user=>USERNAME

Set the username to use when connecting to the remote server.  This
may also be set in the URL (eg. C<http://foo@example.com/disk.img>)

=back

=head1 DEBUG FLAG

=over 4

=item B<-D curl.verbose=1>

This enables very verbose curl debugging.  See L<CURLOPT_VERBOSE(3)>.
This is mainly useful if you suspect there is a bug inside libcurl
itself.
