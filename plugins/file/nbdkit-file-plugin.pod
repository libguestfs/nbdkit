To concatenate multiple files, use L<nbdkit-split-plugin(1)>.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item [B<file=>]FILENAME

be used here.

This parameter is required.

C<file=> is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.
See L<nbdkit(1)/Magic parameters>.

=item B<rdelay>

=item B<wdelay>

These plugin parameters have been moved to the
L<nbdkit-delay-filter(1)> filter.  Modify the command line to add
I<--filter=delay> in order to use these parameters.

Some of the fields which may appear are listed below.  Note these are
for information only and may be changed or removed at any time in the
future.

=over 4

=item C<file_blksszget=yes>

=item C<file_blkzeroout=yes>

If both set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of
block devices, where the driver and block device itself supports this.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_punch_hole=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to punch holes (make sparse) files and
block devices.

=item C<file_falloc_fl_zero_range=yes>

If set, the plugin may be able to efficiently zero ranges of files and
block devices.

=back

=head1 DEBUG FLAG

=over 4

=item B<-D file.zero=1>

This enables very verbose debugging of the NBD zero request.  This can
be used to tell if the file plugin is able to zero ranges in the file
or block device efficiently or not.
