=head1 NAME

nbdkit-gzip-plugin - nbdkit gzip plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit gzip [file=]FILENAME.gz

=head1 DEPRECATED

B<The gzip plugin is deprecated in S<nbdkit E<ge> 1.22.17> and will be
removed in S<nbdkit 1.26>>.  It has been replaced with a filter with
the same functionality, see L<nbdkit-gzip-filter(1)>.  You can use the
filter like this:

 nbdkit file --filter=gzip FILENAME.gz

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-gzip-plugin> is a file serving plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.

It serves the named C<FILENAME.gz> over NBD, uncompressing it on the
fly.  The plugin only supports read-only connections.

B<Note> that gzip files are not very good for random access in large
files because seeking to a position in the gzip file involves
uncompressing lots of data.  A more practical method to compress large
disk images is to use the L<xz(1)> format and L<nbdkit-xz-filter(1)>.

=head1 PARAMETERS
