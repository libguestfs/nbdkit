=head1 NAME

nbdkit-partitioning-plugin - create virtual disk from partitions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit partitioning [file=]part1 [[file=]part2 [file=]part3 ...]
                     [partition-type=mbr|gpt]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-partitioning-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which
creates a partitioned virtual drive from a list of one or more files
each containing single partitions.  The plugin concatenates the files
together and generates a virtual partition table so that NBD clients
see a single partitioned disk.

If you just want to concatenate files together (without adding a
partition table) use L<nbdkit-split-plugin(1)>.  If you want to select
a single partition from an existing disk, use
L<nbdkit-partition-filter(1)>.

The plugin supports read/write access.  To limit clients to read-only
access use the I<-r> flag.

=head2 Partition table type

You can choose either MBR (limited to 4 partitions) or GPT (unlimited)
partition table type.

If the C<partition-type> parameter is not supplied then the default is
chosen as follows: If the number of files is E<gt> 4 then GPT is used.
If the total file size is larger than supported by MBR (approximately
2 TB), then GPT is used.  Otherwise MBR is used for maximum
compatibility.

=head2 Type of each partition

The type of each partition is controlled by a partition type byte (for
MBR) or a partition type GUID (for GPT).  This can be set using the
C<mbr-id> or C<type-guid> parameters respectively and affects the type
of all following files.

=head2 Padding and alignment

Partition sizes are automatically rounded up to a multiple of the 512
byte sector size.

Padding may be added between partitions to provide the best alignment.
This is controlled by the C<alignment> parameter, which affects the
alignment of all following files.

NBD clients may write to partitions, but will get an I/O error if they
try to change the virtual partition table or any padding areas of the
disk.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Create a virtual disk containing boot, swap and root partitions (note
this will not be bootable since the virtual partition table does not
contain a boot sector or boot loader):

 nbdkit partitioning boot.img mbr-id=0x82 swap.img mbr-id=0x83 root.img

Notice that the swap partition is bracketed by C<mbr-id=0x82> to set
the MBR partition type byte to C<0x82> (Linux swap) for the swap
partition, followed by C<mbr-id=0x83> to set the MBR partition type
byte back to C<0x83> (Linux filesystem) for the remaining partition.

From a bare ext4 filesystem, create a virtual partitioned disk:

 nbdkit partitioning ext4fs.img

If the underlying file is a multiple of 512 bytes then this is a
no-op:

 nbdkit --filter=partition partitioning file partition=1

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<file=>FILENAME

One or more files containing partition data.

This parameter is required.

C<file=> may be omitted.  To ensure that the filename does not end up
being parsed accidentally as C<key=value>, prefix relative paths with
C<./> (absolute paths do not need modification).

=item B<partition-type=mbr>

Add an MBR (DOS-style) partition table.  The MBR format is maximally
compatible with clients, but only supports up to 4 partitions.

=item B<partition-type=gpt>

Add a GPT partition table.  Note that as well as the virtual primary
partition table added at the beginning of the disk, a virtual
secondary partition table is added at the end, as required by GPT.

=item B<alignment=>N

Set the alignment of all following files to C<N>.  The default
alignment is 2048 sectors (1 MB).

=item B<mbr-id=>0xN

Set the MBR type byte of all following files to C<0xN>.  Type bytes
are normally specified in hexadecimal, and you must use the C<0x>
prefix to indicate this.  The default is C<0x83> which indicates a
Linux filesystem.

=item B<type-guid=>GUID

Set the GPT partition type GUID of all following files to C<GUID>.
The default is C<0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4> which indicates
a Linux filesystem.

=back

=head1 LIMITS

This plugin only supports primary MBR partitions, hence the limit of 4
partitions with MBR.  This might be increased in future if we
implement support for logical/extended partitions.

Although this plugin can create GPT partition tables containing more
than 128 GPT partitions (in fact, unlimited numbers of partitions,
assuming you have disk space for it), some clients will not be able to
handle this.

Zero length partitions are not allowed and will cause nbdkit to exit
with an error.

The sector size is fixed at 512 bytes.
