nbdkit-floppy-plugin - create virtual floppy disk from directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit floppy [dir=]DIRECTORY
               [label=LABEL]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-floppy-plugin> is a plugin for L<nbdkit(1)> which creates a
virtual FAT-formatted floppy disk image from a directory on the fly.
The files in the specified directory (and subdirectories) appear in
the virtual floppy, which is served read-only over the NBD protocol.

The virtual floppy disk will have a single partition (using an MBR
partition table).  In that partition will be a virtual FAT32
filesystem containing the files.  Long filenames are supported.

To create a CD/ISO, see L<nbdkit-iso-plugin(1)>.  To create a Linux
compatible virtual disk, see L<nbdkit-linuxdisk-plugin(1)>.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Create a virtual floppy disk:

 nbdkit floppy /path/to/directory

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item [B<dir=>]DIRECTORY

Specify the directory containing files and subdirectories which will
be added to the virtual floppy disk.  Files inside this directory will
appear in the root directory of the virtual floppy.

This parameter is required.

C<dir=> is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.
See L<nbdkit(1)/Magic parameters>.

=item B<label=>LABEL

The optional volume label for the filesystem.  This may be up to 11
ASCII characters.  If omitted, C<NBDKITFLOPY> is used.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The maximum size of the disk is around 2TB.  The maximum size of a
single file is 4GB.  Non-regular files (such as block special,
symbolic links, sockets) are not supported and will be ignored.

The plugin does not support writes.

The plugin does not save a temporary copy of the files, so you must
leave the directory alone while nbdkit is running, else you may get an
error for example if the plugin tries to open one of the files which
you have moved or deleted.  (This is different from how
L<nbdkit-iso-plugin(1)> works).

The virtual floppy will not be bootable.  This could be added in
future (using SYSLINUX) but requires considerable work.  As a
workaround use L<nbdkit-iso-plugin(1)> instead.

FAT32 is always used, even for small disks (where dosfstools, for
example, would choose FAT12 or FAT16).  This results in extra wasted
space, but since it is only I<virtual> wasted space it isn't really
important, and it simplifies the implementation greatly.
