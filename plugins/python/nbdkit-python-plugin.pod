=head1 NAME

nbdkit-python-plugin - nbdkit python plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit python /path/to/plugin.py [arguments...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-python-plugin> is an embedded Python interpreter for
L<nbdkit(1)>, allowing you to write nbdkit plugins in Python.

=head2 If you have been given an nbdkit Python plugin

Assuming you have a Python script which is an nbdkit plugin, you run it
like this:

 nbdkit python /path/to/plugin.py

You may have to add further C<key=value> arguments to the command
line.  Read the Python script to see if it requires any.

=head1 WRITING A PYTHON NBDKIT PLUGIN

For an example plugin written in Python, see:
L<https://github.com/libguestfs/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/python/example.py>

Broadly speaking, Python nbdkit plugins work like C ones, so you should
read L<nbdkit-plugin(3)> first.

To write a Python nbdkit plugin, you create a Python file which
contains at least the following required functions (in the top level
C<__main__> module):

 def open(readonly):
   # see below
 def get_size(h):
   # see below
 def pread(h, count, offset):
   # see below

Note that the subroutines must have those literal names (like C<open>),
because the C part looks up and calls those functions directly.  You
may want to include documentation and globals (eg. for storing global
state).  Any other top level statements are run when the script is
loaded, just like ordinary Python.

=head2 Python versions

Python 2 end of life is 2020-01-01 and nbdkit >= 1.16 no longer
supports it.  If you want to use Python 2, you will need to use nbdkit
version 1.14.  You can set the C<PYTHON> environment variable
to the desired interpreter, otherwise nbdkit will use interpreter
called C<python3> or C<python> on the current C<$PATH>.  For example:

 PYTHON=/opt/local/bin/python3 ./configure

To find out which version the Python plugin was compiled for, use the
I<--dump-plugin> option, eg:

 $ nbdkit python --dump-plugin
 ...
 python_version=3.7.0
 python_pep_384_abi_version=3

=head2 Executable script

If you want you can make the script executable and include a "shebang"
at the top:

 #!/usr/sbin/nbdkit python

See also L<nbdkit(1)/Shebang scripts>.

These scripts can also be installed in the C<$plugindir>.  See
L<nbdkit-plugin(3)/WRITING PLUGINS IN OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES>.

=head2 Methods

Your script may use C<import nbdkit> to have access to the following
methods in the C<nbdkit> module:

 nbdkit.set_error(err)

Record C<err> as the reason you are about to throw an exception. C<err>
should correspond to usual errno values, where it may help to
C<import errno>.

=head2 Exceptions

Python callbacks should throw exceptions to indicate errors.  Remember
to use C<nbdkit.set_error> if you need to control which error is sent
back to the client; if omitted, the client will see an error of C<EIO>.

=head2 Python callbacks

This just documents the arguments to the callbacks in Python, and any
way that they differ from the C callbacks.  In all other respects they
work the same way as the C callbacks, so you should go and read
nbdkit-plugin(3).

=over 4

=item C<dump_plugin>

(Optional)

There are no arguments or return value.

=item C<config>

(Optional)

 def config(key, value):
   # no return value

=item C<config_complete>

(Optional)

There are no arguments or return value.

=item C<open>

(Required)

 def open(readonly):
   # return handle

You can return any non-NULL Python value as the handle.  It is passed
back in subsequent calls.

=item C<close>

(Optional)

 def close(h):
   # no return value

After C<close> returns, the reference count of the handle is
decremented in the C part, which usually means that the handle and its
contents will be garbage collected.

=item C<get_size>

(Required)

 def get_size(h):
   # return the size of the disk

=item C<can_write>

(Optional)

 def can_write(h):
   # return a boolean

=item C<can_flush>

(Optional)

 def can_flush(h):
   # return a boolean

=item C<is_rotational>

(Optional)

 def is_rotational(h):
   # return a boolean

=item C<can_trim>

(Optional)

 def can_trim(h):
   # return a boolean

=item C<pread>

(Required)

 def pread(h, count, offset):
   # construct a bytearray of length count bytes and return it

The body of your C<pread> function should construct a buffer of length
(at least) C<count> bytes.  You should read C<count> bytes from the
disk starting at C<offset>.

NBD only supports whole reads, so your function should try to read
the whole region (perhaps requiring a loop).  If the read fails or
is partial, your function should throw an exception, optionally using
C<nbdkit.set_error> first.

=item C<pwrite>

(Optional)

 def pwrite(h, buf, offset):
   length = len (buf)
   # no return value

The body of your C<pwrite> function should write the C<buf> string to
the disk.  You should write C<count> bytes to the disk starting at
C<offset>.

NBD only supports whole writes, so your function should try to
write the whole region (perhaps requiring a loop).  If the write
fails or is partial, your function should throw an exception,
 optionally using C<nbdkit.set_error> first.

=item C<flush>

(Optional)

 def flush(h):
   # no return value

The body of your C<flush> function should do a L<sync(2)> or
L<fdatasync(2)> or equivalent on the backing store.

If the flush fails, your function should throw an exception, optionally
using C<nbdkit.set_error> first.

=item C<trim>

(Optional)

 def trim(h, count, offset):
   # no return value

The body of your C<trim> function should "punch a hole" in the
backing store.  If the trim fails, your function should throw an
exception, optionally using C<nbdkit.set_error> first.

=item C<zero>

(Optional)

 def zero(h, count, offset, may_trim):
   # no return value

The body of your C<zero> function should ensure that C<count> bytes
of the disk, starting at C<offset>, will read back as zero.  If
C<may_trim> is true, the operation may be optimized as a trim as long
as subsequent reads see zeroes.

NBD only supports whole writes, so your function should try to
write the whole region (perhaps requiring a loop).  If the write
fails or is partial, your function should throw an exception,
optionally using C<nbdkit.set_error> first.  In particular, if
you would like to automatically fall back to C<pwrite> (perhaps
because there is nothing to optimize if C<may_trim> is false),
use C<nbdkit.set_error(errno.EOPNOTSUPP)>.

=back

=head2 Missing callbacks

=over 4

=item Missing: C<load> and C<unload>

These are not needed because you can just use ordinary Python
constructs.

=item Missing: C<name>, C<version>, C<longname>, C<description>,
C<config_help>, C<can_fua>, C<can_cache>, C<cache>

These are not yet supported.

=back

=head2 Threads

The thread model for Python callbacks currently cannot be set from
Python.  It is hard-coded in the C part to
C<NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_ALL_REQUESTS>.  This may change or be
settable in future.
