=head1 NAME

nbdkit-null-plugin - nbdkit bitbucket plugin

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit null [[size=]SIZE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-null-plugin> is a null plugin for L<nbdkit(1)>.  Everything
written to the virtual device is discarded, and reads back as zeroes.

Most NBD consumers will be very confused by this device.  Trying to
create filesystems etc on it will likely fail badly.  If the client is
caching writes locally then you will get inconsistent read behaviour.

The null plugin is also used when probing for installed filters, see
L<nbdkit-probing(1)/Detect if a filter is installed>.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item [B<size=>]SIZE

Specify the virtual size of the disk image.

This parameter is optional.  If omitted then a zero-sized device is
created.

C<size=> is a magic config key and may be omitted in most cases.
See L<nbdkit(1)/Magic parameters>.
