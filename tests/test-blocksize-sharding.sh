# Script a server that requires 16-byte aligned requests, and which delays
# 4s after reads if a witness file exists.  Couple it with the delay filter
# that delays 2s before writes. If an unaligned and aligned write overlap,
# and can execute in parallel, we would have this timeline:
#
#     T1 aligned write 1's to 0/16     T2 unaligned write 2's to 4/12
#t=0  blocksize: next->pwrite(0, 16)   blocksize: next->pread(0, 16)
#       delay: wait 2s                   delay: next->pread(0, 16)
#       ...                                eval: read 0's, wait 4s
#t=2    delay: next->pwrite(0, 16)         ...
#         eval: write 1's                  ...
#     return                               ...
#t=4                                     return 0's (now stale)
#                                      blocksize: next->pwrite(0, 16)
#                                        delay: wait 2s
#t=6                                     delay: next->pwrite(0, 16)
#                                          eval: write stale RMW buffer
#
# leaving us with a sharded 0000222222222222 (T1's write is lost).
# But as long as the blocksize filter detects the overlap, we should end
# up with either 1111222222222222 (aligned write completed first), or with
# 1111111111111111 (unaligned write completed first), either taking 8s,
# but with no sharding.
#
# We also need an nbdsh script that kicks off parallel writes.
