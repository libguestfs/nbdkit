# Test the plugins/data/disk2data.pl script.
#
# This is a stochastic test to try to find corner cases.  However if
# we simply used a random disk then we wouldn't be testing the
# particular features of this script, namely that it can skip long
# runs of zeroes and compress short-period repeated data.  So instead
# we have a small script which generates this kind of "disk-like"
# data.
