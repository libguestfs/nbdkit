To-do list for nbdkit
======================================================================

General ideas for improvements
------------------------------

* Listen on specific interfaces or protocols (eg. only IPv6).

* syslog? journal?

* Performance - measure and improve it.

* Bash tab completion.

* Exit on last connection (the default behaviour of qemu-nbd unless
  you use -t).

* Limit number of incoming connections (like qemu-nbd -e).

Suggestions for plugins
-----------------------

* XVA files

  is a partial solution but it needs cleaning up.

* glance

* cinder

Note: qemu supports other formats such as libssh, libnfs, iscsi,
gluster and ceph/rbd, and while similar plugins could be written for
nbdkit there is no compelling reason unless the result is better than
qemu-nbd.  For the majority of users it would be better if they were
directed to qemu-nbd for these use cases.

Suggestions for filters
-----------------------

* adding artificial delays (see wdelay/rdelay options in the file
  plugin)

* injecting artificial errors for testing clients

* copy-on-write, a popular feature in other servers

* export a subset using offset/size

* export a single partition (like qemu-nbd -P)

Composing nbdkit
----------------

Filters allow certain types of composition, but others would not be
possible, for example RAIDing over multiple nbd sources.  Because the
plugin API limits us to loading a single plugin to the server, the
best way to do this (and the most robust) is to compose multiple
nbdkit processes.

The nbd plugin (plugins/nbd) already contains an NBD client, so we
could factor this client out and make it available to other plugins to
use.
