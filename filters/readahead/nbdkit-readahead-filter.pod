=head1 NAME

nbdkit-readahead-filter - prefetch data when reading sequentially

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=readahead plugin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-readahead-filter> is a filter that prefetches data when the
client is reading sequentially.

A common use for this filter is to accelerate sequential copy
operations (like S<C<qemu-img convert>>) when plugin requests have a
high overhead (like L<nbdkit-curl-plugin(1)>).  For example:

 nbdkit -U - --filter=readahead curl https://example.com/disk.img \
        --run 'qemu-img convert $nbd disk.img'

The filter uses a simple adaptive algorithm which accelerates
sequential reads, but has a small penalty if the client does random
reads.  If the client mixes reads with writes or write-like operations
(trimming, zeroing) then it will work but there can be a large
performance penalty.

=head1 PARAMETERS

There are no parameters specific to nbdkit-readahead-filter.  Any
parameters are passed through to and processed by the underlying
plugin in the normal way.
