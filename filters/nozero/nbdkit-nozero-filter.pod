=head1 NAME

nbdkit-nozero-filter - nbdkit nozero filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nbdkit --filter=nozero plugin [plugin-args...] \
   [zeromode=MODE] [fastzeromode=MODE]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nbdkit-nozero-filter> is a filter that intentionally disables
efficient handling of sparse file holes (ranges of all-zero bytes)
across the NBD protocol.  It is mainly useful for evaluating timing
differences between naive vs. sparse-aware connections, and for
testing client or server fallbacks.

=head1 PARAMETERS

=over 4

=item B<zeromode=none>

=item B<zeromode=emulate>

=item B<zeromode=notrim>

=item B<zeromode=plugin>

Optional, controls which mode the filter will use.  Mode B<none>
(default) means that zero support is not advertised to the
client. Mode B<emulate> means that zero support is emulated by the
filter using the plugin's C<pwrite> callback, regardless of whether
the plugin itself implemented the C<zero> callback with a more
efficient way to write zeros. Since nbdkit E<ge> 1.13.4, mode
B<notrim> means that zero requests are forwarded on to the plugin,
except that the plugin will never see the NBDKIT_MAY_TRIM flag, to
determine if the client permitting trimming during zero operations
makes a difference.  Since nbdkit E<ge> 1.15.0, mode B<plugin> leaves
normal zero requests up to the plugin, useful when combined with
C<fastzeromode> for experimenting with the effects of fast zero
requests.  It is an error to request B<notrim> or B<plugin> if the
plugin does not support the C<zero> callback.

=item B<fastzeromode=none>

=item B<fastzeromode=slow>

=item B<fastzeromode=ignore>

=item B<fastzeromode=default>

Optional since nbdkit E<ge> 1.15.0, controls whether fast zeroes are
advertised to the client, and if so, how the filter will react to a
client fast zero request.  Mode B<none> avoids advertising fast zero
support.  Mode B<slow> advertises fast zero support unconditionally,
but treats all fast zero requests as an immediate C<ENOTSUP> failure
rather than performing a fallback.  Mode B<ignore> advertises fast
zero support, but treats all client fast zero requests as if the flag
had not been used (this behavior is typically contrary to the NBD
specification, but can be useful for comparison against the actual
fast zero implementation to see if fast zeroes make a difference).
Mode B<default> is selected by default; when paired with
C<zeromode=emulate>, fast zeroes are advertised but fast zero requests
always fail (similar to C<slow>); when paired with C<zeromode=notrim>
or C<zeromode=plugin>, fast zero support is left to the plugin
(although in the latter case, the nozero filter could be omitted for
the same behavior).

=head1 EXAMPLES

Serve the file F<disk.img>, but force the client to write zeroes
explicitly rather than with C<NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES>:

 nbdkit --filter=nozero file disk.img

Serve the file F<disk.img>, allowing the client to take advantage of
less network traffic via C<NBD_CMD_WRITE_ZEROES>, but fail any fast
zero requests up front and force all other zero requests to write data
explicitly rather than punching any holes:

 nbdkit --filter=nozero file zeromode=emulate disk.img

Serve the file F<disk.img>, but do not advertise fast zero support to
the client even if the plugin supports it:

 nbdkit --filter=nozero file zeromode=plugin fastzeromode=none disk.img
